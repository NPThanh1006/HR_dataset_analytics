# HR_dataset_analytics
Your objective is to answer a series of questions posed by your Group Director, the 
esteemed Dr Andrew Hill, who is well-known for asking awkward questions and being 
a stickler for detail. He is old-school, not very good with technology and thinks he 
hasn’t got where he is today by listening to some over-educated upstarts with fancy 
charts!
Dr Hill has been moaned at by the CEO for his group’s relatively poor productivity 
and employee satisfaction over the past couple of years. He has always thought his 
staff took too many days off sick and that staff turnover was too high. He is now 
looking to your team to identify potential causes of poor productivity and 
engagement. 
He also read an article in the Financial Times that said something about the gender 
pay gap, and now he is concerned that his group might have whatever this gender 
pay gap thingy is.
After doing some initial work with Dr Hill, your team has refined his general concerns 
into four specific question: What, if anything, increases the number of sick days that have been taken over
the past year?
Given Dr Hill’s reluctance with technology there hasn’t been much investment in a 
Data Analytics strategy. However, you do have access to an HR database of 312 
current and ex staff, which contains several helpful fields including salary, most 
recent performance and engagement scores, as well as the usual details such as date 
of hire, position and department
